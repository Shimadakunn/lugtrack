# LugTrack
This project won the first place at the Dauphine Hackaton 2023 organized by Kryptosphere

## Concept
This project aims to track luggages in airports and plane in order to trace your luggage and know who is reponsible in case of a lost.
It writes the state of you luggage on the Etherum blockchain so that it is immutable.
To change the state of the luggage, you have to scan a QR Code of the address mapped to the luggage.

## Features
It comes with an QR Code scanner.
And also with an Owner interface that is visible only when connected with the owner wallet.
